## License 

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
            non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
                Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
                modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
                Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
                as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      
                (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           
                Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          
                permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         
                special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      
                including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    
                goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    
                and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      
                shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   
                limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   
                personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       
                extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               
                jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           
                incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          
                limitation may not apply to You.
